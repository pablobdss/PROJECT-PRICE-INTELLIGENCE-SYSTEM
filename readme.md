> 🇧🇷 [Leia em Português](./README.pt-br.md)

A distributed **price monitoring and intelligence system** designed for learning and experimentation, combining **Go** for high-performance data collection and **Python** for analytics, visualization, and alerts.

This project was built with a strong focus on:
- Software architecture
- Distributed systems
- Event-driven design
- Data engineering fundamentals

It intentionally evolves in stages, from a simple HTTP-based system to a fully decoupled, message-driven architecture.
